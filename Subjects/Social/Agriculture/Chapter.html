<h1>Agriculture</h1>

<p class='italics-para'>Gurpreet, Madho and Tina were walking through the village where they saw a farmer tilling land. The farmer told them that he was growing wheat and had just added manure to the soil to make it more fertile. He told the children that the wheat would fetch a good price in the mandi from where it would be taken to factories to make bread and biscuits from flour.</p>

<p>This transformation from a plant to a finished product involves three types of economic activities. These are <span class='keywords'>primary, secondary and tertiary activities.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Primary activities include all those connected with extraction and production of natural resources. Agriculture, fishing and gathering are good examples.</li>
	<li>Secondary activities are concerned with the processing of these resources. Manufacturing of steel, baking of bread and weaving of cloth are examples of this activity.</li>
	<li>Tertiary activities provide support to the primary and secondary sectors through services. Transport, trade, banking, insurance and advertising are examples of tertiary activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Agriculture is a primary activity. It includes growing crops, fruits, vegetables, flowers and rearing of livestock. In the world, <span class='keywords'>50 per cent of persons</span> are engaged in agricultural activity. <span class='keywords'>Two-thirds of India’s population</span> is still dependent on agriculture.</p>

<p><span class='keywords'>Favourable topography of soil and climate</span> are vital for agricultural activity. The land on which the crops are grown is known as <span class='keywords'>arable land</span> (Fig. 4.1). In the map you can see that agricultural activity is concentrated in those regions of the world where suitable factors for the growing of crops exist.</p>

</ul>
</p>

<h3>Farm System</h3>
<p>Agriculture or farming can be looked at as a system.</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class='keywords'>Inputs:</span> The important inputs are seeds, fertilisers, machinery and labour.</li> 
	<li><span class='keywords'>Processes:</span> Some of the operations involved are ploughing, sowing, irrigation, weeding and harvesting.</li>
	<li><span class='keywords'>Outputs:</span> The outputs from the system include crops, wool, dairy and poultry products.</li>
</ul>	


<h3>Types of farming</h3>
<p>Farming is practiced in various parts of the world. It is classified depending on the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Geographical location</li>
		<li>Demand of produce</li>
		<li>Labour</li>
		<li>Level of technology</li>
	</ul>
	
	<br>

	<p>Farming is of two main types</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class='keywords'>Subsistence</span></li>
		<li><span class='keywords'>Commercial</span></li>
	</ul>
</p>	India

<h4>Subsistence farming</h4>
<p>This type of farming is practised to <span class='keywords'>meet the needs of the farmer’s family</span>. Traditionally, low levels of technology and household labour are used to produce on small output. Subsistence farming can be further classified as 
	<ol>
		<li><span class='heading'>Intensive subsistence</li></span>
		<p>In intensive subsistence agriculture the farmer cultivates a <span class='keywords'>small plot of land using simple tools and more labour</span>. Climate with large number of days with sunshine and fertile soils permit growing of more than one crop annually on the same plot. <span class='keywords'>Rice is the main crop</span>. Other crops include wheat, maize, pulses and oilseeds. Intensive subsistence agriculture is prevalent in the thickly populated areas of the <span class='keywords'>monsoon regions of south, southeast and east Asia</span>.</p>

		<li><span class='heading'>primitive subsistence farming.</span></li>
		<p>Primitive subsistence agriculture includes <span class='keywords'>shifting cultivation and nomadic herding</span>.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><span class='heading'>Shifting cultivation</span> is practised in the thickly forested areas of Amazon basin, tropical Africa, parts of southeast Asia and Northeast India. These are the areas of heavy rainfall and quick regeneration of vegetation. A plot of land is cleared by felling the trees and burning them. The ashes are then mixed with the soil and crops like maize, yam, potatoes and cassava are grown. After the soil loses its fertility, the land is abandoned and the cultivator moves to a new plot. Shifting cultivation is also known as ‘slash and burn’ agriculture.</p>

				<p>Shifting cultivation is known by different names in different parts of the world 
					<ol type='i'>
						<li>Jhumming - North-East India</li> 
						<li>Milpa -Mexico</li> 
						<li>Roca - Brazil</li> 
						<li>Ladang - Malaysia</li>
					</ol>
				</p>	
			</li>

			<li>
				<p><span class='heading'>Nomadic herding</span> is practised in the <span class='keywords'>semi-arid and arid regions of Sahara, Central Asia and some parts of India, like Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir</span>. In this type of farming, <span class='keywords'>erdsmen move from place to place with their animals for fodder and water, along defined routes</span>. This type of movement arises in response to climatic constraints and terrain. Sheep, camel, yak and goats are most commonly reared. They provide milk, meat, wool, hides and other products to the herders and their families.</p>
			</li>	

		</ul>	
	</ol>	
	</p>	

	<h4>Commercial farming</h4>	

	<p>In commercial farming <span class='keywords'>crops are grown and animals are reared for sale in market</span>. The area cultivated and the amount of capital used is large. Most of the work is done by machines. Commercial farming includes 
		<ul>
			<li><span class='heading'>Commercial grain farming</span>
				<p>In commercial grain farming crops are grown for commercial purpose. <span class='keywords'>Wheat and maize</span> are common commercially grown grains. Major areas where commercial grain farming is pracised are <span class='keywords'>temperate grasslands of North America, Europe and Asia</span>. These areas are sparsely populated with large farms spreading over hundreds of hectares. Severe winters restrict the growing season and only a single crop can be grown.</p></li>
			<li><span class='heading'>Mixed farming</span>
				<p>In mixed farming the land is used for <span class='keywords'>growing food and fodder crops and rearing livestock</span>. It is practised in Europe, eastern USA, Argentina, southeast Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.</p></li>
			<li><span class='heading'>Plantation agriculture</span>
				<p>Plantations are a type of commercial farming where <span class='keywords'>single crop of tea, coffee, sugarcane, cashew, rubber, banana or cotton are grown</span>. Large amount of labour and capital are required. The produce may be processed on the farm itself or in nearby factories. <span class='keywords'>The development of a transport network is thus essential for such farming.</span></p>
				<p>Major plantations are found in the tropical regions of the world. <span class='keywords'>Rubber in Malaysia, coffee in Brazil, tea in India and Sri Lanka</span> are some examples.</p></li>
		</ul>	
	</p>

	<h4>Major crops</h4>	

	<p>A large variety of crops are grown to meet the requirement of the growing population. Crops also supply raw materials for agro based industries. Major food crops are wheat, rice, maize and millets. Jute and cotton are fibre crops. Important beverage crops are tea and coffee.</p>

	<h3>Agricultural development</h3>

	<p>Agricultural Development refers to <span class='keywords'>efforts made to increase farm production in order to meet the growing demand of increasing population</span>. This can be achieved in many ways such as 
		<ul>
	    	<li>increasing the cropped area</li>
	    	<li>the number of crops grown</li>
	    	<li>improving irrigation facilities</li>
	    	<li>use of fertilisers</li> 
	    	<li>and high yielding variety (HYV) of seeds</li>
	    </ul>	
	    Mechanisation of agriculture is also another aspect of agricultural development. The ultimate aim of agricultural development is to <span class='keywords'>increase food security</span>.</p>

	<p>Agriculture has developed at different places in different parts of the world. Developing countries with large populations usually practise intensive agriculture where crops are grown on small holdings mostly for subsistence. Larger holdings are more suitable for commercial agriculture as in USA, Canada and Australia. With the help of two case studies of farms — one from India and the other from the USA, let us understand about agriculture in the developing and a developed country.</p>
	


<table>
	<tr>
		<th>A farm in India</th>
	    <th>A farm in the USA</th>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>1) India is a developing country that is agriculture-based. It provides employment to 60% of the total population of the country.</td>
		<td>1) The USA is a developed nation that is not agriculture-based and only 2% of its entire population is employed in agriculture.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2) In India the average farm holdings are small in size, i.e. 2 to 3 hectares.</td>
		<td>2) In the United States, the farm holdings are of huge sizes, i.e. 250 hectares.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3) Majority of the farmers in India are either uneducated or have very basic school knowledge from the village schools</td>
		<td>3) The farmers in the USA are well educated and keep themselves up to date with the latest developments and technologies in the field.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> 4) Indian farmers use man labour extensively with traditional methods and equipment like ploughs (still drawn by an ox).</td>
		<td>4) In the United States, heavy machinery and advanced technologies are used in the fields to maximize their production.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>5) The farming in India is heavily dependent on the weather conditions and considering that the farmers only produce 2 to 3 crops in a year.</td>
		<td>5) The farmers in the USA use scientific methods to study the soil, its contents, improve its quality, and use a variety of methods to irrigate their fields. This increases their productivity to multiple crops a year.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>6) Farmers in India get very little returns.</td>
		<td>6) The US farmers get way bigger returns.</td>
	</tr>
