					<li id='d02'>What are the advantages of electroplating iron with chromium?
						<br><span class='ans'>Chromium is a shiny metal that does not corrode and resists scratches.

					<li id='d03'>Discuss what happens when an electrolyte is dissolved in water, and then an electric current is passed through it.
						<br><span class='ans'>When an electrolyte is dissolved in water, it breaks up into cations (positively-charged ions) and anions (negatively-charged ions). When electric current is passed through the solution, the cations move towards the cathode (negatively-charged electrode) and the anions move towards anode (positively-charged electrode). This results in a chemical change.</span><br><a href='file:///Users/swetamuppidi/Documents/Priyanka/QuestionsByMom/Science/ChemicalEffects_byMom/ChapterHtml.html#d03'>Back to ques</a> </li>

					<li id='d04'>What happens when electricity is passed through tap water?
					<br><span class='ans'>Tap water will conduct electricity to some extent. This is because it has some salts dissolved in it. The electric current will break up water into its constituent gases, hydrogen and oxygen.</span><br><a href='file:///Users/swetamuppidi/Documents/Priyanka/QuestionsByMom/Science/ChemicalEffects_byMom/ChapterHtml.html#d04'>Back to ques</a> </li>

					<li id='e01'>How will you show experimentally that an electric current can bring about a chemical change? What is this phenomenon called?
					<br><span class='ans'>
						Take two iron nails. Clean them with sand paper. Wrap one or two rounds of copper wire around them and connect the other ends of the wires to the two terminals of an electric battery. Take water in a beaker and add to it a little salt or a few drops of sulphuric acid to make it conducting. Immerse the nails (called electrodes) in the solution. Observe the nails carefully. Can you see small bubbles of gases coming out from the water near the nails? It can be checked that the gases evolved are hydrogen and oxygen. The gases come from water- electric current breaks up water into its constituent gases, hydrogen and oxygen. This observation, therefore, shows that electric current has a chemical effect on water. This experiment shows that an electric current can bring about a chemical change. This phenomenon is called electrolysis.

					<li id='e02'>What is electroplating? How will you carry out electroplating of copper in the laboratory? 
					<br><span class='ans'>
						Electroplating is the process of coating a thin layer of a metal (such as gold, silver, chromium, tin or nickel) over another cheaper metal (like iron) by the process of electrolysis. This is done either to protect the metal, or to make it look attractive.

						<img src="images/ChemicalEffectsFig05_fig15.5.png"/>

						To electroplate a metal object with copper in the laboratory, you will need a glass beaker, a thick copper wire, a metal spoon, a battery cell, a solution of copper sulphate, connecting wires and a switch. Fill around three-fourth of the beaker with the copper sulphate solution. Hammer the copper wire to flatten it out and connect it to the positive terminal of the battery. Connect the spoon through a switch to the negative terminal of the battery. Dip both of them in the copper sulphate solution, making sure that they do not touch each other. Put on the switch and let the current pass through the solution for about half an hour. A layer of copper gets deposited on the spoon.</span><br><a href='file:///Users/swetamuppidi/Documents/Priyanka/QuestionsByMom/Science/ChemicalEffects_byMom/ChapterHtml.html#e02'>Back to ques</a> </li>

					<li id='e03'>List four uses of electroplating, giving the reason for electroplating in each case.
					<br><span class='ans'>
						Uses of electroplating:
						<ol type='i' class='ans'>

							<li>Chromium is a shiny metal that does not corrode and resists scratches. It is deposited on other cheaper metals such as iron to make car parts, taps, bicycle handle bars, wheel rims, etc. This makes them look more attractive and also resist corrosion.</li>

							<li>Gold or silver is electroplated on jewellery made out of a cheaper metal to make it look attractive. </li>

							<li>Food kept in iron cans gets spoilt because of reaction with iron. To prevent this, iron is electroplated with tin, which is less reactive than iron, to make tin cans. They are used to store food. </li>

							<li>Zinc is electroplated on iron used to make bridges and automobiles. The coating prevents iron from rusting.</li>

					<li id='hots02'>Mercury is a liquid and conducts electricity. Do you think it is an electrolyte? (HINT: Mercury is a metal that is a liquid at room temperature.)
					<br><span class='ans'>Mercury is a metal which is liquid at room temperature. It consists of mercury atoms and no ions are present. Hence it is not an electrolyte.	</span><br><a href='file:///Users/swetamuppidi/Documents/Priyanka/QuestionsByMom/Science/ChemicalEffects_byMom/ChapterHtml.html#hots02'>Back to ques</a> </li>

					<li id='hots03'>Solid copper sulphate does not conduct electricity, but when it is dissolved in water, it does conduct electricity. Why?
					<br><span class='ans'>Solid copper sulphate does not contain any free electrons or ions to conduct electricity. When it is dissolved in water it breaks up into ions that can conduct electricity.</span><br><a href='file:///Users/swetamuppidi/Documents/Priyanka/QuestionsByMom/Science/ChemicalEffects_byMom/ChapterHtml.html#hots03'>Back to ques</a> </li>

					<br><span class='ans'>Yes, I agree with this statement that copper conducts electricity through electrons, whereas salt solution conducts electricity through ions.</span><br><a href='file:///Users/swetamuppidi/Documents/Priyanka/QuestionsByMom/Science/ChemicalEffects_byMom/ChapterHtml.html#hots04'>Back to ques</a> </li>

					<li id='hots05'>Why should you not touch electrical appliances with wet hands?
					<br><span class='ans'>As water is a good conductor of electricity we should not touch electrical appliances with wet hands. Our body may get electric shock.<</span><br><a href='file:///Users/swetamuppidi/Documents/Priyanka/QuestionsByMom/Science/ChemicalEffects_byMom/ChapterHtml.html#hots05'>Back to ques</a> </li>

					<li id='hots06'>After doing Activity 5 (electroplating a spoon with copper), a student interchanged the connections of the copper plate and the spoon. What do you think will happen now? 
					<br><span class='ans'>If after electroplating a spoon with copper, the connections of the copper plate and the spoon are interchanged, the copper deposited on the spoon will start disappearing and going into solution.</span><br><a href='file:///Users/swetamuppidi/Documents/Priyanka/QuestionsByMom/Science/ChemicalEffects_byMom/ChapterHtml.html#hots06'>Back to ques</a> </li>

					<li id='hots07'>We should not try to put out a fire in an electrical appliance by pouring water on it. Why?
					<br><span class='ans'>Putting out a fire in an electrical appliance by pouring water on it can be dangerous as water conducts electricity and people who come in contact with the water can get electric shocks.</span><br><a href='file:///Users/swetamuppidi/Documents/Priyanka/QuestionsByMom/Science/ChemicalEffects_byMom/ChapterHtml.html#hots07'>Back to ques</a> </li>

					<li id='hots08'>Instead of taking the trouble of electroplating metals with chromium for making car parts, taps, cycle parts, etc., why are these objects not made of chromium itself?
					<br><span class='ans'>Chromium is very expensive. So the objects like car parts, taps, cycle parts, etc. Will not be affordable if made of chromium entirely.</span><br><a href='file:///Users/swetamuppidi/Documents/Priyanka/QuestionsByMom/Science/ChemicalEffects_byMom/ChapterHtml.html#hots08'>Back to ques</a> </li>
