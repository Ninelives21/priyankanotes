    <h3>ELECTRIC CURRENT</h3>
    <p>You have read that if a charged electroscope is connected to an uncharged electroscope by a metal wire, charges flow through the wire for a short while, till the two electroscopes are similarly charged. It is observed that only negative charges flow through the wire. Positive charges remain fixed and do not flow.</p>

	<p>You know that both positively and negatively-charged particles are present inside atoms. The positively-charged particles, called <span class='imp-words'>protons</span>, are heavy and remain fixed in their positions.

    <p>number of positive and negative charges in an atom are equal. The atom as a whole, therefore, shows no charge and is neutral. However, when a glass rod is rubbed with silk, some electrons get ripped off from the glass rod and get transferred to the silk cloth. Thus, the glass rod becomes deficient in electrons and acquires a positive charge. The silk cloth gains excess electrons and acquires an equal negative charge. However, when a plastic comb is rubbed with flannel, electrons are transferred from the flannel to the comb. Thus, the flannel acquires a positive charge and the comb acquires an equal negative charge.</p>

    <p><p>You have read that if a charged electroscope is connected to an uncharged electroscope by a metal wire, charges flow through the wire for a short while, till the two electroscopes are similarly charged. It is observed that only negative charges (electrons) flow through the wire. Positive charges (protons) remain fixed and do not flow.</p>

	<p>The movement of electrons constitutes an <span class='imp-words'>electric current</span>. To make an electric current flow continuously, two things are necessary. Firstly, a continuous, unbroken path or <span class='imp-words'>circuit</span> is needed for the current to flow through. For this, copper wire is generally used as it is a good conductor. A switch is inserted in the circuit to make or break the circuit as required. Secondly, we also need a driving force called <span class='imp-words'>electromotive force</span> to push the electrons that carry the charge around the circuit. This is provided by an electric cell or a generator. </p>

	<br>
	<p><h4>Direction of electric current</h4>
	We know that electrons flow from a body that has an excess of electrons to one that has a deficit of electrons, i.e. from a body that is negatively charged to a body that is positively charged.	
	</p>

	<p>Earlier, scientists thought that electric current is the flow of positive charge from a positively-charged body to a negatively-charged body. They, therefore, took this as the direction of flow of current.</p>

	<p>Today, we consider the flow of <span class='imp-words'>conventional current</span> to be from positive to negative and the flow of <span class='imp-words'>electronic current</span> to be from negative to positive.</p>

	<br>

	<p>
	<h3>Conduction through liquids</h3>
	As you have read earlier, certain substances such as metals allow electric current to flow through them. They are <span class='imp-words'>conductors</span> of electric current. Iron, brass, aluminium, copper, graphite etc., are conductors. Air, wood, paper, cloth, rubber or plastic do not allow electric current to flow through them. They are <span class='imp-words'>insulators</span>. We can test for conductors and insulators in the following way.

    	</div>	

    	<p>Make an electric circuit consisting of a cell and a bulb connected through insulating copper wires as shown. Touch the free ends of the wire together for a fraction of a second. If the bulb glows, your tester is ready and working. If it does not glow, check the wires, the connections and the battery one by one to see where the problem lies.</p>

		<p>You can test different substances by connecting them to the two free ends of the wire (Fig. 15.1). If the bulb glows, the substance is a conductor. If it does not glow, the substance is an insulator. Try the experiment with a piece of wood, an iron nail, an aluminium spoon, the lead of a pencil, paper, cloth, an eraser and a plastic spoon.</p>

    	</div>

    		<p>You can test different liquids for their electrical conductivity by connecting them to the two free ends of the wires of your tester. If the bulb glows, the liquid conducts electricity. Try this experiment with distilled water, tap water, salt solution, sugar solution, lime juice, vinegar and honey.</p>
			
			<p>An easy way of doing this is by putting a drop of the liquid on a table and touching the two ends of the wire to it. You can also take a small amount of the liquid in the plastic cap of a mineral water bottle. After testing each liquid, remember to wash the ends of the wire in water and dry them before testing another liquid.</p>

			<div class='box-in-box-parent'>
				<div class='box-in-box-child'>
					<p>While testing liquids, you may find that the bulb does not glow as brightly as with metals. This is because liquids are not such good conductors as metals. Sometimes, the current flowing may be too little for the bulb to glow. For testing conductivities of liquids, we can use an LED (light emitting diode) in the circuit instead of FIG. 15.2 a bulb. The LED lights up even An LED if the current is very small. Remember, however, that in an LED, <span class='imp-words'>the longer lead is connected to the positive, end of the cell and the shorter end to the negative end</span>.</p>

		<P>You will find that distilled water is a poor conductor of electricity, but when salt is dissolved in it, it becomes a good conductor. Tap water also conducts electricity. This is because tap water is not pure water and has some salts dissolved in it. But a sugar solution does not conduct electricity.</P>

		<p>Lime water also conducts electricity. You know that lime is acidic. Let us see if other acidic and basic solutions also conduct electricity.</p>

		<p>It can be checked that the gases evolved are hydrogen and oxygen. Where did these gases come from? What does this indicate? The gases come from water-electric current breaks up water into its constituent gases, hydrogen and oxygen. This observation, therefore, shows that electric current has a chemical effect on water.</p>

  		<p>(NOTE: The amount of salt added should be very small. If a concentrated solution of salt in water is electrolyzed, hydrogen and chlorine gases are evolved, instead of hydrogen and oxygen.)</p>

  		<p>This activity shows that an <span class='imp-words'>electric current can bring about a chemical change</span>.</p>

  		<p>A substance which conducts electricity in the liquid state or when dissolved in water and breaks up chemically during the process is called an electrolyte. The process of breaking up of an <span class='imp-words'>electrolyte</span> chemically on passing an electric current through it is called <span class='imp-words'>electrolysis</span>.</p>

  		<p>When an electrolyte such as copper sulphate is dissolved in water, it breaks up into positively and negatively-charged particles called <span class='imp-words'>ions</span>. Positively-charged ions are called <span class='imp-words'>cations</span> while negatively-charged particles are called <span class='imp-words'>anions</span>. Ions move about freely in aqueous solution.</p>

  		<p>When electric current is passed through the solution, the cations move towards the negatively-charged electrode (cathode) and anions towards the positively-charged electrode (anode). This results in a chemical change (Fig 15.4).</p>

  		<h3>Uses of electrolysis</h3>	

  		<p><h4>Electroplating</h4>
  		Electrolysis has a number of applications. The most common of these is <span class='imp-words'>electroplating</span>, i.e. coating a thin layer of a metal, such as gold, silver, chromium, tin or nickel, over another cheaper metal. This is done either to protect he metal, or to make it look attractive.</p>


	  		<ul>
	  			<li>Chromium is a shiny metal that does not corrode and resists scratches. It is deposited on other cheaper metals such as iron to make car parts, taps, bicycle handle bars, wheel rims, etc. This makes them look more attractive and also resist corrosion.</li></ul></p

  		<p>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Gold or silver is electroplated on jewellery made out of a cheaper metal to make it look attractive.</li>
	  			<li>Food kept in iron cans gets spoilt because of reaction with iron. To prevent this, iron is electroplated with tin, which is less reactive than iron, to make tin cans. They are used to store food.</li>
	  			<li>Zinc is electroplated on iron used to make bridges and automobiles. The coating prevents iron from rusting.</li>

	    	</div>

	    	<p>You will need a glass beaker, a thick copper wire, a metal spoon, a battery cell, a solution of copper sulphate, connecting wires and switch</p>

	    	<p>Fill around three-fourth of the beaker with the copper sulphate solution. Hammer the copper wire to flatten it out and connect it to the positive terminal of the battery. Connect the spoon through a switch to the negative terminal of the battery. Dip both of them in the copper sulphate solution, making sure that they do not touch each other (Fig. 15.6). Put on the switch and let the current pass through the solution for about half an hour. Does a layer of copper get deposited on the spoon?</p>

		<p>When copper sulphate is dissolved in water, it forms positively-charged copper ions and negatively-charged sulphate ions. When an electric current is passed through the solution: 
			<ul>
				<li>The copper ions (cations) move towards the cathode, pick up electrons from there (supplied by the electric current), and get deposited on it as copper atoms.</li>
				<li>At the anode, the copper atoms in the copper plate lose electrons to form copper ions. The ions go into solution. Thus, the copper lost to the cathode is restored by the anode.</li>
			</ul>	

			<p>Therefore, the anode slowly dissolves into the solution, while a layer of copper gets deposited on the cathode. The sulphate ions do not take part in the chemical reaction. Thus, the net effect is that <span class='imp-words'>copper gets transferred from the anode to the cathode</span>.</p>

			<p>This method can be used to deposit a layer of any metal on another material.</p>

			<p>The above arrangement consisting of an electrolyte, two electrodes (anode and cathode) and a source of current is called an electrolytic cell. The <span class='imp-words'>electrolytic cell</span> converts electrical energy to chemical energy.</p>

			<h4>Extraction of metals</h4>

			<p>Metals such as calcium, magnesium and aluminium are extracted from their ores by electrolysis.</p>

			<h4>Purification of metals</h4>

			<p>You saw that in Activity 5, during electrolysis, copper is transferred from the anode to the cathode. This process is used to purify copper obtained from its ores.</p>

			<p>The impure copper is made the anode and a thin strip of pure copper is made the cathode. As in Activity 5, the electrolyte is copper sulphate solution. When current is passed, pure copper from the impure anode is transferred to the cathode. Insoluble impurities settle down below the anode as <span class='imp-words'>anode mud</span>.</p>
